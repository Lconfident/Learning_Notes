查询工资最低的部门信息

```mysql
# 方法一
SELECT
	* 
FROM
	departments 
WHERE
	department_id = (
	SELECT
		department_id 
	FROM
		employees 
	GROUP BY
		department_id 
HAVING
	avg( salary ) <= ALL ( SELECT min( avg_sal ) FROM ( SELECT avg( salary ) avg_sal FROM employees GROUP BY department_id ) t_avg_sal ));
	
	
# 方法二：（最先想到）avg(salary)<=all()
SELECT
	* 
FROM
	departments 
WHERE
	department_id = (
	SELECT
		department_id 
	FROM
		employees 
	GROUP BY
		department_id 
HAVING
	avg( salary ) <= ALL ( SELECT avg( salary ) avg_sal FROM employees GROUP BY department_id ));
	
# 方法三：avg(salary) = (...limit 0,1);
SELECT
	* 
FROM
	departments 
WHERE
	department_id = (
	SELECT
		department_id 
	FROM
		employees 
	GROUP BY
		department_id 
HAVING
	avg( salary ) = ( SELECT avg( salary ) avg_sal FROM employees GROUP BY department_id HAVING avg_sal ORDER BY avg_sal LIMIT 0, 1 ));
	
# 方法四：直接利用排序分页，显示一行记录，然后把他当作虚拟表进行数据过滤（只用一层循环）
select d.*
from departments d,(
	SELECT
		avg( salary ) avg_sal,
		department_id
	from employees e
	group by department_id
	order by avg_sal
	limit 0,1
) t_avg_sal
where d.department_id = t_avg_sal.department_id
```

查询平均工资最低的部门信息和该部门的平均工资（相关子查询）

```mysql
#方法一：从虚拟表中选择出最低平均工资
SELECT
	d.*,
	t_avg_sal.avg_sal 
FROM
	departments d,
	( SELECT avg( salary ) avg_sal, department_id FROM employees GROUP BY department_id ORDER BY avg_sal LIMIT 0, 1 ) t_avg_sal 
WHERE
	d.department_id = t_avg_sal.department_id
	
#方法二：从select上进行相关子查询
SELECT *,( SELECT avg( salary ) FROM employees WHERE d.department_id = department_id ) 
FROM
	departments d 
WHERE
	department_id = (
	SELECT
		department_id 
	FROM
		employees 
	GROUP BY
		department_id 
HAVING
	avg( salary ) <= ALL ( SELECT avg( salary ) avg_sal FROM employees GROUP BY department_id ));
```

查询平均工资最高的job信息

```mysql
#方法一：建立虚拟表，子查询
SELECT j.* 
FROM jobs j,( SELECT job_id, avg( salary ) avg_sal FROM employees GROUP BY job_id ORDER BY avg_sal DESC LIMIT 0, 1 ) jobs_avg_sal 
WHERE
	j.job_id = jobs_avg_sal.job_id;
	
# 方法二：job_id = (...avg(salary) >= all(...))
SELECT
	* 
FROM
	jobs 
WHERE
	job_id = (
	SELECT
		job_id 
	FROM
		employees 
	GROUP BY
		job_id 
HAVING
	avg( salary ) >= ALL ( SELECT avg( salary ) FROM employees GROUP BY job_id ));
```

查询平均工资高于公司平均工资的部门

```mysql
SELECT department_id FROM employees WHERE department_id IS NOT NULL GROUP BY department_id HAVING avg( salary ) >( SELECT avg( salary ) FROM employees )
```

查询公司中所有manager的详细信息

```mysql
select distinct *
from employees mgr
where exists (select manager_id from employees where manager_id = mgr.employee_id )
```

查询平均工资最高的部门的manager的详细信息

```mysql
select *
from employees mgr
where employee_id in (
	select distinct manager_id
	from employees emp,(select department_id,avg(salary) avg_sal
											from employees emp
											group by department_id
											order by avg_sal DESC
											limit 0,1) t_avg_sal
	where emp.department_id = t_avg_sal.department_id
)
```

查询部门的部门号，其中不包括job_id是"ST_CLERK"的部门号 

```mysql
SELECT
	department_id,
	department_name 
FROM
	departments 
WHERE
	department_id NOT IN ( SELECT department_id FROM employees WHERE job_id = 'ST_CLERK' );
```

选择所有没有管理者的员工的last_name

```mysql
select last_name
from employees mgr
where not exists (
	select manager_id
	from employees emp
	where mgr.employee_id = emp.manager_id);
```

~~查询各部门中工资比本部门平均工资高的员工的员工号, 姓名和工资(难)~~

```mysql
#方法一：在部门相同的情况下比较salary
select employee_id,last_name,salary,department_id
from employees e1
where salary > (
	select avg(salary)
	from employees e2
	where e2.department_id = e1.department_id 
)

#方法二：在虚拟表中过滤条件de_id相同与salary比较
SELECT employee_id, last_name, salary, e2.department_id 
FROM employees e2,( SELECT avg( salary ) avg_sal, department_id FROM employees GROUP BY department_id ) e3 
WHERE
	e2.department_id = e3.department_id 
	AND e2.salary > e3.avg_sal 
```
